// Write a class that represents a Circle . It has only one data property - itâ€™s radius , and it is set trough the
// constructor . The class needs to have getter and setter methods for its diameter - the setter needs to calculate
// the radius and change it and the getter needs to use the radius to calculate the diameter and return it.
// The circle also has a getter area() , which calculates and returns its area.
